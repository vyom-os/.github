## Hi there 👋

Vyom is building the platform to power the future of autonomous robots and drones.

We are creating a software-defined ecosystem to empower the robotics industry with unmatched adaptability, flexibility, and scalability, to operate and orchestrate their fleets.

We are building:

Vyom IQ (https://vyomiq.io) Command centre in the cloud to operate, orchestrate, monitor, and aggregate data from your robot and drone fleets. It unifies planning, teleoperation, observability, data capture, and fleet health monitoring into a single pane of glass.

Vyom GCS (Ground Control Station): For more granular mission planning and real-time operation of drones and bots, either autonomously or with human-in-the-loop.

Vyom AI Pilots (https://www.vyomos.org) Truly autonomous AI pilots for your drones and robots to ensure they can navigate, optimize flight paths, avoid obstacles and complete missions, on their own if needed.

We call this complete platform, the Vyom OS: A hardware agnostic operating system which ensures easy & optimal operations in the complete value chain, from edge devices in the field to centralized data store.
